Here's a **detailed breakdown of Source Code Management (SCM) in Jenkins**, especially focusing on how Jenkins connects with Git-based repositories (like GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab), manages credentials, and uses webhooks for automatic triggers.

---

## ✅ 5. **Source Code Management (SCM) in Jenkins**

Jenkins integrates with **Source Code Management systems** to pull code, detect changes, and trigger builds. The most common SCM tools Jenkins connects to are:

* **Git (most popular)**
* Subversion (SVN)
* Mercurial
* Perforce (via plugin)

We’ll focus on **Git-based systems**: GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

---

### ✅ Connecting Git Repositories in Jenkins

#### 1️⃣ **GitHub (via HTTPS or SSH)**

**Steps (for both Freestyle and Pipeline jobs):**

* Install **Git Plugin** and **GitHub Plugin** (if not already installed).
* In Jenkins job:

  * Go to `Source Code Management` → Select **Git**.
  * Enter GitHub repo URL:

    * **HTTPS**: `https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git`
    * **SSH**: `git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git`
  * Provide **credentials** (username/password or SSH key) securely.

> ✅ For SSH:

* Use `ssh-keygen` to generate key pair.
* Add public key to GitHub → **Settings > SSH and GPG keys**
* Add **private key** to Jenkins using:

  * Jenkins Dashboard → **Manage Jenkins** → **Credentials** → Global → Add credentials → `SSH Username with private key`

---

#### 2️⃣ **Bitbucket Integration**

* Jenkins supports Bitbucket via **Bitbucket plugin** and **Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin**.
* In Git URL:

  * **HTTPS**: `https://bitbucket.org/your-org/your-repo.git`
  * **SSH**: `git@bitbucket.org:your-org/your-repo.git`
* Configure **webhooks** in Bitbucket to notify Jenkins on push.

> 🔐 Use app passwords or SSH keys for authentication.

---

#### 3️⃣ **GitLab Integration**

* Install **GitLab Plugin** for webhook support.
* Configure:

  * Git URL: `https://gitlab.com/your-org/your-repo.git`
  * Use **GitLab Personal Access Token (PAT)** or **SSH key**
* Add webhook in GitLab under:

  * **Settings > Webhooks** → URL: `http://<jenkins_url>/project/<job_name>`

---

### ✅ Webhook Integration for Automatic Job Trigger

Webhooks allow Jenkins to **automatically trigger builds** when a change is pushed to the repository.

#### 🔁 GitHub Webhook Steps

1. In Jenkins:

   * Create a job or pipeline.
   * Enable:
     ✅ `GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling`

2. In GitHub:

   * Go to your repo → **Settings > Webhooks**
   * Click **Add Webhook**

     * **Payload URL**: `http://<jenkins-server>/github-webhook/`
     * **Content type**: `application/json`
     * Select: “Just the push event”
   * Click **Add webhook**

3. In Jenkins:

   * Install **GitHub Integration Plugin** (if not already).
   * Set webhook to trigger your pipeline.

> ✅ Webhooks are **more efficient** than SCM polling (`Poll SCM`) which checks periodically.

### ✅ Using Credentials Securely in Jenkins

Managing secrets and credentials is critical to secure SCM access.

#### 🔐 **Types of Credentials Jenkins Supports**

| Type                       | Use Case                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Username + Password        | HTTPS Git authentication        |
| SSH Username + Private Key | Git SSH authentication          |
| Secret Text                | GitHub PAT or GitLab Token      |
| Certificate                | SSL Auth                        |
| Secret File                | Encrypted files like kubeconfig |

#### 🔑 **Steps to Add Credentials**

1. Jenkins Dashboard → **Manage Jenkins** → **Credentials**
2. Select a domain (e.g., Global)
3. Click **Add Credentials**
4. Choose appropriate **Kind**:

   * For SSH → "SSH Username with private key"
   * For PAT → "Secret Text"
5. Provide ID, description (used in pipeline/job config), and actual value.

---

### ✅ Referencing Credentials in Jenkins Pipeline

**Declarative Pipeline Example using GitHub HTTPS + PAT:**

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  environment {
    GIT_TOKEN = credentials('github-pat-id')  // Secret Text type
  }
  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        git url: "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git",
            credentialsId: 'github-cred-id' // HTTPS or SSH credential
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Declarative Pipeline with SSH checkout:**

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Clone') {
      steps {
        git branch: 'main',
            credentialsId: 'my-ssh-key',
            url: 'git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## ✅ **Jenkins SCM Interview Questions and Answers**

---

### 🔹 **Basic Level**

---

**1. What is SCM in Jenkins?**
**Answer:**
SCM (Source Code Management) in Jenkins allows the automation server to pull source code from repositories like GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, etc., so it can build, test, and deploy the application.

---

**2. Which SCM tools does Jenkins support?**
**Answer:**
Jenkins supports:

* Git (via Git plugin)
* GitHub (via GitHub plugin)
* GitLab
* Bitbucket
* Subversion (SVN)
* Mercurial
* Perforce

---

**3. How can Jenkins connect to a GitHub repository?**
**Answer:**
Jenkins can connect to GitHub using:

* HTTPS (with username/password or PAT)
* SSH (with SSH key pair)
  You need to configure the credentials in Jenkins and use them in the job or pipeline.

---

**4. What is the purpose of the `credentialsId` in a Jenkins pipeline?**
**Answer:**
`credentialsId` links a secure Jenkins credential (like SSH key or token) to your pipeline. It tells Jenkins which stored credential to use when accessing the SCM.

---

### 🔹 **Intermediate Level**

---

**5. What is the difference between SCM polling and webhooks?**
**Answer:**

* **SCM Polling**: Jenkins checks the repo at regular intervals to detect changes. Resource-intensive.
* **Webhooks**: The SCM (e.g., GitHub) sends a push notification to Jenkins when a change is made. More efficient and immediate.

---

**6. How do you securely store Git credentials in Jenkins?**
**Answer:**
Use Jenkins’ built-in **Credentials Manager**:

* Go to `Manage Jenkins > Credentials`
* Add SSH key, username/password, or token
* Reference it in jobs using `credentialsId`

---

**7. How do you configure a GitHub webhook to trigger Jenkins?**
**Answer:**

* In Jenkins, enable “GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling”.
* In GitHub:

  * Go to Repo > Settings > Webhooks > Add Webhook
  * Payload URL: `http://<jenkins-server>/github-webhook/`
  * Set content type as `application/json`
  * Select “Just the push event”

---

**8. How does Jenkins authenticate with Git repositories over SSH?**
**Answer:**

* Generate an SSH key pair (`ssh-keygen`)
* Add the public key to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
* Store the private key in Jenkins (Credentials → SSH Username with private key)
* Use the `credentialsId` to connect via pipeline or Freestyle job

---

**9. What plugins are needed for GitHub integration in Jenkins?**
**Answer:**

* Git plugin
* GitHub plugin
* GitHub Branch Source plugin (for multibranch pipelines)
* Credentials plugin

---

### 🔹 **Advanced / Scenario-Based**

---

**10. Scenario:**
*You are using HTTPS to connect to GitHub, and builds are failing due to deprecation of password-based authentication. What will you do?*
**Answer:**

* Create a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** on GitHub with `repo` scope.
* Store PAT in Jenkins as **Secret Text** credential.
* Use `credentialsId` in your pipeline to use the token.
* Update Git URL in Jenkins job to `https://github.com/user/repo.git`.

---

**11. Scenario:**
*Your Jenkins job is not triggering on a Git push. How will you troubleshoot webhook integration?*
**Answer:**

* Check Jenkins job configuration → Ensure “GitHub hook trigger” is enabled.
* Check GitHub repo → Settings → Webhooks → Verify delivery logs.
* Ensure `http://<jenkins-server>/github-webhook/` is reachable.
* Check Jenkins logs (`/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`) for errors.
* Make sure the job is configured with the correct Git URL and branch.

---

**12. Scenario:**
*You need to set up a Jenkins pipeline that checks out code from a private GitLab repository over SSH. What steps will you take?*
**Answer:**

1. Generate SSH key pair and add the public key to GitLab.
2. Add the private key to Jenkins under `Credentials` → `SSH Username with private key`.
3. Reference the `credentialsId` in your pipeline:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        git url: 'git@gitlab.com:your-org/your-repo.git',
            credentialsId: 'gitlab-ssh-key'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

**13. Scenario:**
*You want to check out a Git repository only if a specific branch is updated. How can you configure this?*
**Answer:**

* Use a multibranch pipeline or filter branches in your pipeline code:

```groovy
when {
  branch 'main'
}
```

* Or, in a Freestyle job, set the Git branch to build under `Branch Specifier` as `*/main`.

---

**14. Scenario:**
*You’re using Jenkins with Bitbucket and want to trigger a build on push. What are the steps?*
**Answer:**

* Install **Bitbucket plugin**
* Configure Git repo in Jenkins using HTTPS or SSH
* In Bitbucket:

  * Go to Repo → Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook
  * Use: `http://<jenkins-server>/bitbucket-hook/`
  * Enable trigger on push events
* Enable the “Build when a change is pushed to Bitbucket” trigger in Jenkins
