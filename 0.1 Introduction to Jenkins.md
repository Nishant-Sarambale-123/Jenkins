Here are **detailed notes on Jenkins**, covering the topics you listed:

---

## **1. Introduction to Jenkins**

### ✅ What is Jenkins?

**Jenkins** is an open-source **automation server** written in Java. It helps automate the **non-human part of software development**—like **building**, **testing**, and **deploying** applications. Jenkins is a key tool in the **DevOps** and **CI/CD pipeline** ecosystem.

* Initially developed as **Hudson** at Sun Microsystems.
* Renamed to **Jenkins** after Oracle acquired Sun.
* Extensible via **plugins** (over 1,800 available).

> 🔧 **Key Function:** Automates continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) processes.

---

### ✅ Why Use Jenkins?

Jenkins is widely adopted because it simplifies and **automates** many parts of the software delivery lifecycle:

#### 🔁 **1. Continuous Integration (CI)**

* Automatically builds and tests code whenever changes are pushed to version control (like Git).
* Helps catch bugs early in the development cycle.

#### 🚀 **2. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**

* Automates deployment to testing, staging, or production environments.
* Ensures faster and reliable delivery of applications.

#### 🧩 **3. Extensibility via Plugins**

* Supports plugins for Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, Slack, AWS, Azure, etc.
* Customize pipelines and integrations.

#### 📊 **4. Monitoring & Reporting**

* Provides logs, build results, test reports, and build history.

#### 🔒 **5. Access Control & Security**

* Integrates with LDAP, AD, SSO, and role-based access.

#### ⚙️ **6. Supports All Phases of DevOps Lifecycle**

* From code commit to deployment and monitoring.

> ✅ **Benefits:**

* Saves time by automating repetitive tasks.
* Reduces human errors.
* Enables rapid, frequent releases.
* Encourages collaboration between development and operations teams.

### ✅ Jenkins Architecture (Master-Agent)

Jenkins follows a **Master-Agent architecture** for scalability and load distribution.

#### 🧠 **1. Jenkins Master (Controller)**

* Main Jenkins server.
* Manages:

  * Web UI
  * Configuration
  * Job scheduling
  * Dispatching builds to agents
  * Plugins and system configuration

> Think of it as the "brain" of Jenkins.

#### 🛠️ **2. Jenkins Agent (Node/Slave)**

* A machine (physical or virtual) that runs build jobs assigned by the master.
* Can run different environments (Linux, Windows, Docker, etc.)
* Can be dynamically created using cloud plugins (e.g., AWS EC2).

#### 🔗 **3. Communication**

* Master and Agent communicate using **SSH**, **JNLP**, or **WebSockets**.
* Can use static agents or configure **cloud-based** auto-scaling agents (via Kubernetes, EC2, etc.).

#### 📦 **4. Labeling**

* Agents can be tagged with **labels** to target specific environments/tools (e.g., Java, Node.js, Docker).

> 💡 **Benefits of Master-Agent Architecture:**

* Distributes load to multiple machines.
* Supports parallel builds.
* Isolates different environments.
* Increases scalability and performance.

+----v----+                     +----v----+
| Agent 1 |                     | Agent 2 |
| Linux   |                     | Windows |
+---------+                     +---------+

(Each agent runs builds on its own OS/toolchain.)

7. **How does Jenkins support version control systems (VCS)?**

   > Through plugins like Git Plugin, Jenkins integrates with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc., to poll changes and trigger builds.

8. **What is a Jenkinsfile?**

   > A text file checked into the source code repo that defines the Jenkins pipeline using either **Declarative** or **Scripted** syntax.

9. **How do you trigger a build automatically?**

   > Using:

   * SCM polling (`Poll SCM`)
   * Webhooks (e.g., GitHub)
   * Scheduled CRON jobs
