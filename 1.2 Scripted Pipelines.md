## âœ… 12. Scripted Pipelines (Groovy)

### ðŸ”· What is a Scripted Pipeline?

A **Scripted Pipeline** in Jenkins is written using **Groovy**. It provides **complete flexibility and control** over the CI/CD workflow but requires **more code** and **programming knowledge** than Declarative Pipelines.

> Unlike declarative syntax (which is simpler and more opinionated), Scripted Pipelines use **imperative programming style**.

### ðŸŸ¡ Declarative vs Scripted Pipeline

| Feature         | Declarative                   | Scripted                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Syntax          | Structured YAML-like          | Groovy code                 |
| Learning Curve  | Easier                        | Moderate to Advanced        |
| Flexibility     | Less                          | High                        |
| Error Handling  | Limited                       | Full try/catch support      |
| Recommended for | Beginners, standardized CI/CD | Advanced, dynamic workflows |

### ðŸ”’ Best Practices

* Always use `try-catch-finally` for error handling.
* Use `timeout` to prevent infinite execution.
* Use `params` and `input` to handle dynamic user input.
* Use `env` to manage environment variables.
* Prefer parallel builds for test stages when possible.

Here are the **interview questions and answers (basic to advanced)** and **scenario-based Q\&A** for Jenkins Scripted Pipelines:

---

## âœ… **Basic Interview Questions with Answers**

### 1. **What is a scripted pipeline in Jenkins?**

**Answer:**
A scripted pipeline is a type of Jenkins pipeline written using Groovy syntax inside a `node {}` block. It provides full flexibility and control for complex CI/CD workflows.

---

### 2. **How is a scripted pipeline different from a declarative pipeline?**

**Answer:**

* **Scripted:** Groovy-based, flexible, less readable, ideal for advanced use cases.
* **Declarative:** YAML-like structured syntax, more readable, limited flexibility, preferred for standard use.

---

### 3. **What is the role of the `node` block?**

**Answer:**
The `node` block allocates an executor on an agent and runs the pipeline inside that node. It's the starting point of any scripted pipeline.

---

### 4. **Which programming language is used for scripted pipelines?**

**Answer:**
Groovy is used in scripted pipelines.

---

### 5. **Can you run shell commands in scripted pipelines? How?**

**Answer:**
Yes. Use the `sh` step for Unix or `bat` for Windows:

```groovy
sh 'echo Hello'
```

---

## âœ… **Intermediate Interview Questions with Answers**

### 6. **What is the purpose of `try/catch` in a scripted pipeline?**

**Answer:**
To handle errors gracefully. It allows you to catch and handle exceptions without aborting the entire pipeline.

---

### 7. **How do you handle failures gracefully in a scripted pipeline?**

**Answer:**
Use `try/catch/finally` blocks to handle errors and perform cleanup tasks even if a stage fails.

---

### 8. **What is the role of `currentBuild.result`?**

**Answer:**
It allows you to set or check the current build's result (e.g., SUCCESS, FAILURE, UNSTABLE).

Example:

```groovy
currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
```

---

### 9. **How can you execute stages in parallel in scripted pipelines?**

**Answer:**
Use the `parallel` step:

```groovy
parallel(
  "Unit Tests": { sh 'run-unit.sh' },
  "Integration Tests": { sh 'run-integration.sh' }
)
```

---

### 10. **How can you reuse Groovy functions across pipeline stages?**

**Answer:**
Define functions inside the script or use shared libraries:

```groovy
def greet(name) {
  echo "Hello, ${name}"
}
```

---

## âœ… **Advanced Interview Questions with Answers**

### 11. **How would you implement dynamic stage generation in a scripted pipeline?**

**Answer:**
Use a loop to dynamically create stages:

```groovy
def apps = ['app1', 'app2']
apps.each { app ->
  stage("Build ${app}") {
    sh "build ${app}"
  }
}
```

---

### 12. **Explain how you would integrate approval before deployment using scripted pipeline.**

**Answer:**
Use the `input` step for manual approval:

```groovy
stage('Approval') {
  input message: 'Approve Deployment?'
}
```

---

### 13. **How do you share variables between stages in a scripted pipeline?**

**Answer:**
Define variables outside stages:

```groovy
def version = 'v1.0'
node {
  stage('Build') { echo "Version: ${version}" }
  stage('Deploy') { echo "Deploying ${version}" }
}
```

---

### 14. **What are the security risks of using scripted pipelines?**

**Answer:**

* Scripted pipelines allow arbitrary Groovy execution.
* Can be used to run unsafe shell commands.
* Require script approval (in sandbox mode) to mitigate risks.

---

### 15. **How would you use input for user approval with timeout and default response?**

**Answer:**

```groovy
timeout(time: 2, unit: 'MINUTES') {
  input message: 'Proceed to deploy?', ok: 'Yes'
}
```

## ðŸ“˜ Scenario-Based Q\&A

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Scenario 1: Error Handling**

**Q:** You have build, test, and deploy stages. If test fails, skip deploy but do cleanup.
**A:**

```groovy
node {
  try {
    stage('Build') {
      sh 'make build'
    }

    stage('Test') {
      sh 'make test'
    }

    stage('Deploy') {
      sh './deploy.sh'
    }

  } catch (e) {
    echo "Error occurred: ${e}"
    currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
  } finally {
    stage('Cleanup') {
      cleanWs()
    }
  }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Scenario 2: Parallel Execution**

**Q:** Run unit tests and integration tests in parallel.
**A:**

```groovy
node {
  stage('Test') {
    parallel(
      "Unit Tests": {
        sh 'npm run test:unit'
      },
      "Integration Tests": {
        sh 'npm run test:integration'
      }
    )
  }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Scenario 3: User Input for Approval**

**Q:** Pause pipeline for manual approval before deployment.
**A:**

```groovy
stage('Approval') {
  input message: 'Approve Deployment?', ok: 'Yes, Deploy'
}
stage('Deploy') {
  sh './deploy.sh'
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Scenario 4: Dynamic Stage Creation**

**Q:** Run a stage for each app in a list of apps.
**A:**

```groovy
def apps = ['app1', 'app2', 'app3']
node {
  apps.each { app ->
    stage("Build ${app}") {
      sh "build-tool ${app}"
    }
  }
}
```
