Here are **detailed notes** on **Jenkins Pipeline (Declarative & Scripted)** including structure, syntax, differences, and usage of Jenkinsfile with full examples and key points:

---

## üîß 10. Jenkins Pipeline (Declarative & Scripted)

---

### üîπ What is a Jenkins Pipeline?

A **Jenkins Pipeline** is a set of automated steps to build, test, and deploy software. Pipelines are defined using code in a file called a **`Jenkinsfile`**, which is stored in the version control repository.

> üí° Think of a pipeline as CI/CD as code.

---

### üî∏ **Why Use Jenkins Pipeline?**

* Automates software delivery processes
* Supports **build ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy** workflows
* Enables **Pipeline-as-Code** (stored in Git)
* Supports advanced features like:

  * Parallel execution
  * Conditional stages
  * Shared libraries
  * Input approval
  * Notifications

---

## üìù Jenkinsfile

A **Jenkinsfile** is a text file that contains the pipeline definition and is stored in the project repository.

**Benefits:**

* Versioned with source code
* Easy to review and audit
* Supports reuse and collaboration

## üìò Types of Jenkins Pipelines

| Type        | Syntax Language     | Structure                  | Best For                         |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Declarative | Groovy (simplified) | Structured & user-friendly | Most use cases                   |
| Scripted    | Pure Groovy         | Flexible, complex logic    | Advanced workflows, custom logic |

---

## ‚úÖ Declarative Pipeline

### üì¶ Syntax Example:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        echo 'Building...'
        sh 'mvn clean package'
      }
    }

    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        echo 'Testing...'
        sh 'mvn test'
      }
    }

    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        echo 'Deploying...'
        sh './deploy.sh'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Components:

| Block      | Description                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `pipeline` | Root block of the Jenkinsfile           |
| `agent`    | Defines where to run (e.g., any, label) |
| `stages`   | Logical group of steps (e.g., Build)    |
| `steps`    | Actual shell or scripted steps          |

---

### üìå Optional Blocks:

* `environment` ‚Äì define env vars
* `tools` ‚Äì install JDK, Maven, etc.
* `post` ‚Äì actions after success/failure
* `parameters` ‚Äì user-defined input

---

### üìù Sample with Post and Env:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  environment {
    ENV_NAME = 'production'
  }

  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        git 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'
      }
    }

    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn clean install'
      }
    }
  }

  post {
    success {
      echo 'Build succeeded!'
    }
    failure {
      echo 'Build failed!'
    }
  }
}
```

---

## üîß Scripted Pipeline

* Written in **full Groovy syntax**
* Wrapped inside a `node {}` block
* Offers more **custom logic** and **control flow**

### üì¶ Example:

```groovy
node {
  stage('Checkout') {
    git 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'
  }

  stage('Build') {
    echo 'Running Build...'
    sh 'mvn package'
  }

  stage('Test') {
    echo 'Running Tests...'
    sh 'mvn test'
  }

  stage('Deploy') {
    echo 'Deploying App...'
    sh './deploy.sh'
  }
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Differences Between Declarative and Scripted

| Feature              | Declarative                   | Scripted                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Syntax               | Structured, simple            | Flexible, full Groovy          |
| Ease of Use          | Beginner-friendly             | Requires Groovy knowledge      |
| Validation           | Validated by Jenkins editor   | No strict validation           |
| Error-prone          | Less                          | More (due to flexibility)      |
| `post`, `when`, etc. | Supported out-of-the-box      | Must write manually            |
| Use Case             | Most standard CI/CD workflows | Custom logic, dynamic behavior |

## üì¶ Jenkins Pipeline Features

| Feature       | Description                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `parallel`    | Run multiple branches/stages in parallel           |
| `when`        | Conditional execution of stages                    |
| `input`       | Wait for user approval                             |

### üõë Common Mistakes

* Mixing Scripted and Declarative syntax
* Not storing Jenkinsfile in source control
* Not defining an agent (build fails silently)
* Skipping `post` block (no error handling)

---

## üß∞ Best Practices

* Always use a **Jenkinsfile stored in Git**
* Prefer **Declarative pipeline** for most projects
* Use `environment` to manage secrets or tokens
* Use `post` for cleanup, notifications
* Use `parameters` for dynamic pipeline inputs
* Keep pipelines modular using **shared libraries**

Let me know when you're ready for the **interview questions and scenario-based Q\&A** on Jenkins Pipelines.
Here are **interview questions and scenario-based Q\&A** for **Jenkins Pipelines (Declarative & Scripted):**

---

### üîç **Interview Questions ‚Äì Jenkins Pipelines**

#### 1. **What is a Jenkins Pipeline?**

* **Answer:** A Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins that allows you to define your build, test, and deployment processes as code using a `Jenkinsfile`. It enables continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

---

#### 2. **What is the difference between Declarative and Scripted Pipelines?**

* **Answer:**

| Feature     | Declarative                     | Scripted                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Syntax      | Structured, simple YAML-like    | Groovy-based, fully programmable |
| Readability | More readable and user-friendly | More flexible, less readable     |
| Validation  | Jenkins validates syntax        | No built-in validation           |
| Use Case    | Simple CI/CD workflows          | Complex logic and conditions     |

---

#### 3. **What is a `Jenkinsfile`? Why is it important?**

* **Answer:** A `Jenkinsfile` is a text file that contains the pipeline definition. It should be stored in the source code repository. It allows teams to version their CI/CD logic, promote reuse, and implement Infrastructure as Code.

---

#### 4. **Can you run parallel stages in Jenkins Pipeline?**

* **Answer:** Yes. Both Declarative and Scripted pipelines support parallel execution. Example:

```groovy
parallel {
  stage('Unit Tests') {
    steps { echo 'Running unit tests' }
  }
  stage('Integration Tests') {
    steps { echo 'Running integration tests' }
  }
}
```

---

#### 5. **What is the use of the `agent` directive in a pipeline?**

* **Answer:** It defines where (which node/agent) the pipeline or a specific stage should run. Example: `agent any` allows Jenkins to run the job on any available agent.

---

#### 6. **How do you handle post-build actions in pipelines?**

* **Answer:** Use the `post` section to define steps that should run after build, regardless of result.

```groovy
post {
  always { echo 'Runs always' }
  success { echo 'Runs on success' }
  failure { echo 'Runs on failure' }
}
```

---

#### 7. **What are input steps in Jenkins pipeline?**

* **Answer:** They allow manual intervention. Jenkins pauses the pipeline and waits for human input before proceeding.

```groovy
input {
  message 'Approve deployment?'
  ok 'Yes, proceed'
}
```

---

#### 8. **Can you explain environment variables in Jenkins pipelines?**

* **Answer:** Use the `environment` block to define environment variables available throughout the pipeline or stage.

```groovy
environment {
  ENV_NAME = "staging"
}
```

---

#### 9. **How do you handle credentials securely in Jenkins pipeline?**

* **Answer:** Use the `credentials()` helper to inject credentials securely.

```groovy
withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'git-creds', usernameVariable: 'USER', passwordVariable: 'PASS')]) {
  sh 'git clone https://$USER:$PASS@github.com/repo.git'
}
```

---

#### 10. **How do you reuse shared code across multiple pipelines?**

* **Answer:** Use **Shared Libraries** in Jenkins. Define reusable Groovy scripts and load them into pipelines using `@Library`.

---

### üß† **Scenario-Based Questions and Answers**

---

#### ‚úÖ **Scenario 1: Trigger pipeline only when code changes in `src/` directory**

**Q:** You want to trigger your pipeline only when changes are made in the `src/` directory. How would you do it?

**A:** Use the `when` condition with `changeset` filter:

```groovy
stage('Build') {
  when {
    changeset "src/**"
  }
  steps {
    echo 'Changes in src directory detected.'
  }
}
```

---

#### ‚úÖ **Scenario 2: Cancel running pipeline if a new build is triggered**

**Q:** You want to avoid long-running builds piling up. How do you cancel older builds when a new one starts?

**A:** Use `options` directive with `disableConcurrentBuilds()`:

```groovy
pipeline {
  options {
    disableConcurrentBuilds()
  }
  ...
}
```

---

#### ‚úÖ **Scenario 3: Conditional stage execution based on environment**

**Q:** You only want to deploy if the environment is `production`. How?

**A:**

```groovy
stage('Deploy') {
  when {
    environment name: 'ENV', value: 'production'
  }
  steps {
    echo 'Deploying to production...'
  }
}
```

---

#### ‚úÖ **Scenario 4: Reusing the same steps across multiple stages**

**Q:** You have a test step that runs the same shell command in different stages. How do you avoid duplication?

**A:** Create a custom method (in Scripted pipeline) or use Shared Libraries.

---

#### ‚úÖ **Scenario 5: Handle build failure but continue pipeline**

**Q:** Your test stage may fail but should not stop the deployment stage. What will you do?

**A:**

```groovy
stage('Test') {
  steps {
    catchError(buildResult: 'SUCCESS', stageResult: 'FAILURE') {
      sh './run-tests.sh'
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### ‚úÖ **Scenario 6: Approve before deploying to production**

**Q:** You want a manual approval step before deploying to prod.

**A:**

```groovy
stage('Approval') {
  steps {
    input message: 'Approve Production Deployment?'
  }
}
```
