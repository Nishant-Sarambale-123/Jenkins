Here are **detailed notes on Jenkins Monitoring and Logs** including explanations and examples:

---

## **17. Monitoring and Logs in Jenkins**

Monitoring Jenkins is crucial to ensure reliability, performance, and quick troubleshooting. Jenkins provides several built-in and plugin-based tools to monitor logs, system health, resource usage, and job output.

---

### 🔍 **1. Jenkins System Logs**

#### 📌 Location:

* Managed via:
  **`Manage Jenkins → System Log`**

#### 📖 Description:

* Shows **real-time logs** of Jenkins internal operations.
* You can **create custom log recorders** to monitor specific parts (e.g., plugins, security, builds).

#### 🛠️ Features:

* Tail logs directly in the web UI.
* Filter logs based on components or log levels (INFO, WARNING, SEVERE, etc.)

#### ✅ Example Use Cases:

* Debugging plugin issues.
* Tracking authentication attempts.
* Monitoring job failures due to internal errors.

---

### 🧾 **2. Console Output per Job**

#### 📌 Location:

* Navigate to a build:
  **`Job → Build # → Console Output`**

#### 📖 Description:

* Shows step-by-step logs of what happens during job execution.
* Useful for debugging **build failures**, script errors, or plugin behavior.

#### ✅ Example:

```sh
Started by user admin
Building in workspace /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/test-job
Running shell script
+ echo 'Hello Jenkins!'
Hello Jenkins!
Finished: SUCCESS
```

---

### 💾 **3. Disk Usage**

#### 🔌 Plugin: `Disk Usage Plugin`

#### 📖 Description:

* Shows disk space usage per job, build, and workspace.
* Helps identify **old or large jobs** consuming space.

#### 📌 Location:

* After installing:
  **`Manage Jenkins → Disk Usage`**
  or within individual jobs/builds.

#### ✅ Use Cases:

* Monitor Jenkins master/agent disk usage.
* Clean up unused jobs/artifacts.

---

### 📊 **4. Load Statistics**

#### 📌 Location:

* **`Manage Jenkins → Load Statistics`**

#### 📖 Description:

* Visual graphs of:

  * Number of executors in use.
  * Job queue length.
  * Job completion over time.
* Helps understand system load and performance trends.

#### ✅ Use Case:

* Identify if more build agents are needed.
* Monitor queue bottlenecks or peak usage times.

---

### 📈 **5. Use Monitoring Plugin (Prometheus/Grafana)**

#### 🔌 Plugins:

* **Prometheus Metrics Plugin**
* **Monitoring Plugin**
* **Metrics Plugin**

---

#### ⚙️ Prometheus Metrics Plugin

* Exposes Jenkins metrics in **Prometheus format**.
* Works with **Grafana** for dashboards.

##### 🔧 Setup:

1. Install Prometheus Metrics Plugin.
2. Enable endpoint:
   `http://<jenkins-host>/prometheus/`
3. Add this URL as a scrape target in Prometheus.
4. Visualize using **Grafana Jenkins Dashboards**.

##### 📊 Metrics Collected:

* Queue size, executor usage.
* Job success/failure rates.
* HTTP response times.

---

#### 🔧 Monitoring Plugin

* Provides JVM, CPU, memory, and thread statistics.

##### Stats Provided:

* Heap memory usage
* GC activity
* File descriptors
* Thread counts

---

## 🧪 Best Practices

* Enable **log rotation** for job history (Manage Jenkins → Configure System).
* Regularly **purge old builds** to save disk.
* Use tools like **Prometheus + Grafana** for scalable visualization.
* Setup **alerts** for disk space, queue lengths, or job failures.

## ✅ Interview Questions

### Q1: How do you view system logs in Jenkins?

**Answer:**
Go to **Manage Jenkins → System Log** to view real-time internal logs. You can also define **custom loggers** for different components.

---

### Q2: How can you monitor Jenkins disk usage?

**Answer:**
Install the **Disk Usage Plugin** to view space used by jobs, builds, and workspaces. Helps identify large or obsolete items.

---

### Q3: How to integrate Jenkins monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana?

**Answer:**
Install **Prometheus Metrics Plugin**, enable the `/prometheus` endpoint, configure Prometheus to scrape it, and visualize data in Grafana.

---

### Q4: What is the use of Jenkins Console Output?

**Answer:**
Console Output shows real-time logs of individual job executions, helpful for debugging job-specific issues.

---

### Q5: What are Jenkins load statistics used for?

**Answer:**
They help identify system load patterns like queue size, number of executors in use, and job throughput, which can guide scaling decisions.
