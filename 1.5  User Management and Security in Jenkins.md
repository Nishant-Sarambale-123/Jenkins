## 🔐 15. User Management and Security in Jenkins

### ✅ Key Concepts:

#### 1. **Matrix-based Security**:

* Fine-grained access control system.
* Allows assigning specific permissions (read, write, configure, build, etc.) per user or group for **global** or **project level**.
* Supports anonymous, authenticated users, or specific user roles.

#### 2. **Project-based Matrix Authorization**:

* Extends matrix-based security to **individual jobs/projects**.
* Example: One team can access and configure only their pipeline jobs.

#### 3. **Role-based Strategy Plugin**:

* Adds roles and assigns users/groups to roles.
* **Three scopes**:

  * **Global roles** (access to entire Jenkins)
  * **Project roles** (specific jobs)
  * **Slave roles** (specific nodes/agents)

#### 4. **LDAP / Active Directory Integration**:

* Jenkins can integrate with enterprise LDAP/AD for centralized authentication.
* Users login with their domain credentials.
* Permissions can be mapped to LDAP groups.

#### 5. **Other Plugins**:

* **SAML Plugin** – for Single Sign-On (SSO).
* **Crowd 2 Plugin** – Atlassian Crowd integration.
* **GitHub OAuth Plugin** – OAuth-based login via GitHub.

## 🧠 Interview Questions + Answers

### 1. **Q: How does Jenkins handle user authentication and authorization?**

**A:**

* **Authentication** verifies user identity (via Jenkins internal database, LDAP, AD, etc.).
* **Authorization** determines what actions users can perform (using matrix-based security, role strategy plugin, etc.).

---

### 2. **Q: What is Matrix-based security in Jenkins?**

**A:**
Matrix-based security lets you assign fine-grained permissions per user or group for different Jenkins actions such as `read`, `build`, `administer`, `configure`. It's useful in environments where multiple users work with different levels of access.

---

### 3. **Q: What is the difference between Global and Project-based security?**

**A:**

* **Global security** applies to the whole Jenkins instance.
* **Project-based security** allows configuring access per-job basis using matrix or role-based rules.

---

### 4. **Q: How can you restrict certain jobs to specific teams in Jenkins?**

**A:**
By using the **Role-Based Strategy Plugin** or **Project-based matrix authorization**, you can assign access to jobs only to members of a particular team or user group.

---

### 5. **Q: Can Jenkins use Active Directory for login?**

**A:**
Yes. Jenkins integrates with **Microsoft Active Directory** via the **Active Directory plugin**, allowing users to log in using domain credentials.

## 📘 Scenario-Based Q\&A

### ✅ Scenario 1:

**Q:** You want DevOps engineers to have admin access, QA team to have read-only access to all jobs, and developers to have build permission on their projects. How would you configure this?

**A:**

1. Install and configure the **Role-Based Strategy Plugin**.
2. Define **Global Roles**:

   * `Admin`: full access (assign to DevOps).
   * `Read-Only`: only read access (assign to QA).
3. Define **Project Roles**:

   * `BuildOnly`: assign build/configure permission (assign to Developers).
   * Use **regex** or job naming pattern (e.g., `dev-*`) to assign projects.
4. Assign users/groups to roles accordingly.

---

### ✅ Scenario 2:

**Q:** A new intern should only be able to view a specific job but not trigger it. How would you achieve that?

**A:**

* Use **Project-based matrix authorization** or **Role Strategy Plugin**.
* Assign the intern `read` permission only for that job.
* Remove or avoid `build` and `configure` permissions.

---

### ✅ Scenario 3:

**Q:** Your company uses LDAP for authentication. You want Jenkins to sync with it. What would you do?

**A:**

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security**.
2. Select **LDAP** as the Security Realm.
3. Enter LDAP server details (e.g., `ldap://ldap.company.com`).
4. Provide search base (e.g., `dc=company,dc=com`).
5. Test connection and save.

---

### ✅ Scenario 4:

**Q:** How would you prevent anonymous users from accessing Jenkins UI?

**A:**

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security**.
2. Under Authorization (e.g., Matrix), remove all permissions for `Anonymous`.
3. Ensure only authenticated users have permissions assigned.
