## 🔐 13. Jenkins Credentials Management – Detailed Notes

### ✅ What is Credentials Management in Jenkins?

Jenkins credentials management allows you to **securely store and manage secrets**, such as:

* GitHub access tokens
* SSH private keys
* AWS IAM credentials
* DockerHub credentials
* Database passwords
* API tokens

These secrets can then be used in Jenkins jobs or pipelines **without hardcoding them** into scripts.

### 🔑 Types of Credentials Jenkins Supports

| Type                              | Description                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Username and Password**         | For basic auth (e.g., DockerHub, GitHub)       |
| **SSH Username with Private Key** | For SSH-based Git access                       |
| **Secret Text**                   | Used for tokens, API keys                      |
| **Secret File**                   | Upload a file (e.g., service account JSON)     |
| **Certificate**                   | For SSL-based auth                             |
| **AWS Credentials**               | Stores AWS access key ID and secret access key |

---

### 📂 Credential Scopes

| Scope      | Visibility                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Global** | Available to all jobs                        |
| **System** | Internal use (not exposed to build jobs)     |
| **Folder** | Only jobs within a specific folder           |
| **Agent**  | Credentials available to specific agent only |

---

### 🔐 Storing Credentials Securely

1. Navigate to:
   `Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Credentials > (Global or Folder scope)`

2. Choose credential type:
   `Username/Password`, `Secret Text`, `SSH Key`, etc.

3. Give each credential a **unique ID** (e.g., `github-token`, `dockerhub-creds`)

---

### 🔁 Using `credentialsId` in Pipelines

#### 📌 Example: Using GitHub Token (Secret Text)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Clone Repo') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'github-token', variable: 'GIT_TOKEN')]) {
                    sh 'git clone https://$GIT_TOKEN@github.com/your/repo.git'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 📌 Example: SSH Key Access

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('SSH Access') {
            steps {
                sshagent(['ssh-key-id']) {
                    sh 'ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@host "uptime"'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 📌 Example: DockerHub Login

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Docker Login') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'dockerhub-creds',
                                                 usernameVariable: 'DOCKER_USER',
                                                 passwordVariable: 'DOCKER_PASS')]) {
                    sh 'docker login -u $DOCKER_USER -p $DOCKER_PASS'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 🔒 Best Practices

* ❌ **Never hardcode secrets** in scripts or Groovy code
* ✅ **Use `withCredentials{}`** block to automatically mask secrets
* 🔄 Rotate secrets regularly (e.g., token expiration)
* 🛑 Limit scope (use folder-level creds where possible)
* 📜 Use descriptive `credentialsId` (like `aws-prod-creds`, `gitlab-ssh-key`)
* ✅ Enable **Audit Trail plugin** to track who accessed or modified credentials

Credentials in Jenkins are used to securely store and access sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, SSH keys, tokens, or cloud secrets. This ensures that secrets are not hardcoded in build scripts and remain masked in logs.

---

### 2. **Where are Jenkins credentials stored?**

**Answer:**
They are stored in the Jenkins home directory in an **encrypted form** (`credentials.xml`). Jenkins uses the **Credentials Plugin** to manage them securely.

---

### 3. **How do you create credentials in Jenkins?**

**Answer:**

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins > Credentials**
2. Select the **domain** (global or folder-specific)
3. Click **Add Credentials**
4. Choose the type (username/password, secret text, SSH key, etc.)
5. Provide a unique **ID**, username, secret/token
6. Save it

---

### 4. **What is the `credentialsId` in Jenkins?**

**Answer:**
`credentialsId` is a unique identifier assigned to a credential. It is used in pipeline scripts to reference the stored secret securely.

---

### 5. **How do you use credentials in a Jenkins pipeline?**

**Answer:**
Using the `withCredentials` block in a declarative or scripted pipeline:

```groovy
withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'my-token', variable: 'TOKEN')]) {
  sh 'curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://api.example.com'
}
```

---

### 6. **How do you use SSH credentials in Jenkins?**

**Answer:**
You can use the `sshagent` block to provide the SSH key to shell commands:

```groovy
sshagent(['my-ssh-key']) {
  sh 'ssh user@host'
}
```

---

### 7. **What types of credentials are supported in Jenkins?**

**Answer:**

* Username and Password
