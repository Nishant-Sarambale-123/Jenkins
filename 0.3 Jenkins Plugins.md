* Ensure you install/update **all required dependencies**.
* If dependency conflict arises:

  * Downgrade or upgrade to compatible versions.
  * Use the **Plugin Compatibility Matrix** on [plugins.jenkins.io](https://plugins.jenkins.io).
* Backup Jenkins before plugin changes.

---

### 🔸 Q5: How do you send email notifications from Jenkins?

**Answer:**
Install **Email Extension Plugin**, then:

* Configure SMTP settings under **Manage Jenkins → Configure System**.
* Use `emailext` in the pipeline:

  ```groovy
  post {
    failure {
      emailext subject: 'Build Failed',
               body: 'Check the Jenkins logs.',
               to: 'team@example.com'
    }
  }
  ```

---

### 🔸 Q6: What is the Blue Ocean plugin used for?

**Answer:**
Blue Ocean provides a **modern UI for Jenkins Pipelines** with visual pipeline views, error highlighting, and simple pipeline creation. It is useful for teams that want an easier, more visual interface over the classic Jenkins UI.

---

### 🔸 Q7: How can Jenkins integrate with Docker?

**Answer:**
Use the **Docker Pipeline Plugin** to:

* Run builds inside Docker containers
* Build and push Docker images
* Example:

  ```groovy
  pipeline {
    agent {
      docker { image 'maven:3.8.1-jdk-11' }
    }
    stages {
      stage('Build') {
        steps {
          sh 'mvn clean install'
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

---

### 🔸 Q8: What is the role of the SonarQube Scanner plugin?

**Answer:**
It integrates SonarQube into Jenkins for **static code analysis**. It:

* Analyzes code quality during builds
* Reports code smells, bugs, and coverage
* Enforces quality gates

---

### 🔸 Q9: Can Jenkins work without plugins?

**Answer:**
Jenkins core is very minimal. Most functionalities (e.g., SCM, build triggers, notifications) require plugins. So while Jenkins can technically start without plugins, it's **not usable** without them.

---

### 🔸 Q10: How can you check plugin update history or roll back a plugin?

**Answer:**

* Jenkins doesn't support plugin rollback natively.
* Use **backup tools** like *ThinBackup* or manually backup:

  * `/var/lib/jenkins/plugins/`
  * `/var/lib/jenkins/updates/`
* Check version changelogs on [plugins.jenkins.io](https://plugins.jenkins.io)

---

## 🧠 Scenario-Based Questions

---

### 🔸 Scenario 1: Git Plugin Failure

**You set up a pipeline with Git integration, but the build fails with a Git authentication error. What do you do?**

**Solution:**

* Ensure Git plugin is installed and updated.
* Go to **Credentials → Add Git credentials (SSH or HTTPS token)**.
* In the pipeline, reference the credentials:

  ```groovy
  git credentialsId: 'git-creds-id', url: 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'
  ```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 2: Email Alerts Not Sending

**Your team reports they are not receiving Jenkins build failure emails. How would you debug this?**

**Steps:**

1. Ensure **Email Extension Plugin** is installed.
2. Verify **SMTP server settings** in **Manage Jenkins → Configure System**.
3. Check Jenkins logs for errors (`/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`).
4. Run a test email from the configuration page.
5. Ensure email is configured in pipeline:

   ```groovy
   emailext to: 'team@example.com', subject: 'Build Failed'
   ```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 3: Slack Notifications Not Working

**Slack integration worked earlier but has stopped after Jenkins upgrade. What could be wrong?**

**Resolution:**

* Verify **Slack plugin** is compatible with current Jenkins version.
* Check webhook URL and Slack API tokens.
* Reconfigure Slack in **Manage Jenkins → Configure System**.
* Add Slack channel and credentials again if needed.

---

### 🔸 Scenario 4: Pipeline for Dockerized App

**You want to run integration tests inside a Docker container as part of your pipeline. How?**

**Solution:**

* Install **Docker Pipeline Plugin**.
* Sample Jenkinsfile:

  ```groovy
  pipeline {
    agent {
      docker { image 'node:18' }
    }
    stages {
      stage('Test') {
        steps {
          sh 'npm install'
          sh 'npm test'
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 5: SonarQube Analysis Not Triggering

**You've configured SonarQube but Jenkins doesn't run analysis. What do you check?**

**Checklist:**

1. Ensure **SonarQube Scanner Plugin** is installed.
2. Add SonarQube in **Manage Jenkins → Global Tool Configuration**.
3. In pipeline:

   ```groovy
   withSonarQubeEnv('MySonar') {
     sh 'mvn sonar:sonar'
   }
   ```
4. Ensure proper credentials and permissions are set in SonarQube.

---

### 🔸 Scenario 6: Update Plugin Without Internet

**Your Jenkins instance is offline. How do you install/update a plugin?**

**Solution:**

1. Download the `.hpi` or `.jpi` file from [https://plugins.jenkins.io](https://plugins.jenkins.io) on another machine.
2. Copy it to Jenkins server at:

   ```
   /var/lib/jenkins/plugins/
   ```
