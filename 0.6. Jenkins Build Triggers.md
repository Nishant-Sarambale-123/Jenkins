Here’s a **complete explanation of Jenkins Build Triggers** – including concepts, syntax, examples, use cases, **interview questions**, and **scenario-based Q\&A**.

---

## 🔁 6. Jenkins Build Triggers

Build triggers define **when and how a Jenkins job should run**. Jenkins offers various mechanisms to initiate a build.

---

### ✅ 1. **Manual Trigger**

#### 📌 Description:

* Triggered **manually** by clicking **“Build Now”** in the Jenkins UI.
* No automation involved.

#### ✅ Use Case:

* Running ad-hoc builds
* Testing a pipeline change before automating it

---

### ⏰ 2. **Periodic Build (CRON)**

#### 📌 Description:

* Automatically triggers builds on a **scheduled basis**
* Uses **CRON syntax** to define timing

#### ⏱️ Syntax Example:

```
H/5 * * * *    → Every 5 minutes
H 2 * * *      → Every day at 2 AM
H H * * 1-5    → Once a day (Mon–Fri) at a random time
```

> `H` means Jenkins will assign a random value to reduce server load.

#### ✅ Use Case:

* Nightly builds
* Scheduled testing
* Automated backups

#### ⚠️ Note:

Make sure the **“Build periodically”** option is enabled.

---

### 🔄 3. **Poll SCM (Source Control Management)**

#### 📌 Description:

* Jenkins checks the SCM (Git/SVN) repo for changes on a defined schedule.
* If a change is detected, a build is triggered.

#### ⏱️ CRON Example:

```
H/15 * * * *  → Poll every 15 minutes
```

#### ✅ Use Case:

* When SCM doesn't support webhooks
* When fine-grained control over polling is needed

#### ⚠️ Note:

* It does **not** build unless changes are detected.
* Consumes resources due to polling.

---

### 🌐 4. **Webhook Trigger (Push-based from GitHub/GitLab)**

#### 📌 Description:

* Jenkins is triggered **immediately** by SCM systems via **webhooks**
* Real-time build triggering on **code push or pull request**

#### ✅ How to Configure:

* Enable **“GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling”** in the job
* Add a **webhook** URL in GitHub/GitLab:

  ```
  http://<jenkins_url>/github-webhook/
  ```

#### ✅ Use Case:

* Fast feedback on commits
* PR builds
* CI on push

#### ⚠️ Notes:

* Jenkins must be accessible from GitHub (public URL)
* Needs GitHub plugin & GitHub credentials in Jenkins

---

### 🔗 5. **Trigger from Another Job**

#### 📌 Description:

* A downstream job is triggered when an **upstream job** completes.

#### ✅ How to Configure:

* In Job A (upstream), go to **“Post-build Actions”** → **“Build other projects”**
* Specify Job B (downstream)

#### ✅ Use Case:

* Build dependencies (e.g., Build → Test → Deploy)
* Chained job workflows

---

### 🔄 Bonus: Trigger from Script or API

* Jenkins provides a **REST API** to trigger jobs programmatically.
* Useful in integrations or automation scripts:

  ```
  curl -X POST http://<jenkins_url>/job/<job_name>/build?token=<token>
  ```

## 💬 Interview Questions

### ✅ Basic

1. **What is the purpose of build triggers in Jenkins?**

   > To define how and when a Jenkins job should be executed automatically or manually.

2. **What is the difference between Poll SCM and Webhook trigger?**

   > Poll SCM checks for changes periodically; Webhook pushes notification instantly when a change occurs.

3. **What does this CRON expression mean: `H/10 * * * *`?**

   > Trigger every 10 minutes, with `H` spreading load across instances.

4. **Can we trigger a Jenkins job from another job?**

   > Yes, using “Build other projects” in post-build actions.

5. **How would you trigger a build on a push to a GitHub repository?**

   > Configure a webhook in GitHub and enable "GitHub hook trigger" in Jenkins.

---

### 🧠 Scenario-Based

1. **Scenario:** You want a nightly build to run at 2 AM from Monday to Friday.
   **Q: What CRON syntax would you use?**

   > `0 2 * * 1-5`

2. **Scenario:** Your code should build instantly when pushed to GitHub.
   **Q: What is the best trigger method?**

   > Use GitHub webhook trigger for real-time builds.

3. **Scenario:** You want to avoid wasting Jenkins resources by polling every minute.
   **Q: What would you recommend instead of Poll SCM?**

   > Use webhooks for push-based builds.

4. **Scenario:** You want Job B to execute only if Job A completes successfully.
   **Q: How do you set this up?**

   > In Job A, add “Build other projects” with Job B and enable "Trigger only if build succeeds".

5. **Scenario:** A build is triggering, but even with no code changes.
   **Q: What might be the reason?**

   > Likely using periodic trigger or Poll SCM without checking for actual changes.
