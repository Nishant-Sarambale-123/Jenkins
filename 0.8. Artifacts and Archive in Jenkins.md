Here are **detailed notes** on **Artifacts and Archive in Jenkins**, including concepts, configuration, file paths, usage tips, and post-build actions:

---

## 📦 8. Artifacts and Archive in Jenkins

---

### 🔹 What are Artifacts in Jenkins?

**Artifacts** are files generated during the build process that are saved and stored as part of the job history. These files are preserved so they can be:

* Downloaded manually
* Referenced in downstream jobs
* Included in reports or notifications

> Examples: JAR files, WAR files, logs, test reports, HTML reports, ZIP packages.

---

### 🔹 What is Archiving in Jenkins?

**Archiving artifacts** means Jenkins will:

* Save specific files generated during a build
* Make them available via the **"Artifacts"** link on the job/build page
* Optionally retain them for a configured number of builds

---

## 📁 Archiving Build Artifacts

### 🔧 How to Configure:

1. Go to a Jenkins job → **Configure**
2. Under **Post-build Actions** → Click **“Archive the artifacts”**
3. Enter file patterns for the files you want to archive.

### 📌 Example Patterns:

```bash
**/target/*.jar           → Archives all JARs from target folders
build/logs/*.log          → Archives logs
reports/**/*.html         → Archives HTML reports
```

### ⚠️ Notes:

* Use **Ant-style wildcards**.
* If files are not found, Jenkins will mark build as **unstable** by default.
* You can disable this failure behavior via job settings.

---

## 📧 Post-Build Actions Overview

### 1. **Send Emails**

* Send email notifications to developers/users after the build.
* Can include:

  * Status: Success/Failure
  * Logs, Reports, Build URL

#### ✅ Plugin Required:

> **Email Extension Plugin**

#### 🔧 Configuration:

* Enable “Editable Email Notification”
* Set Recipients, Subject, and Content
* Attach artifacts or include links

---

### 2. **Archive Reports or Logs**

#### Commonly Archived Reports:

* Test results (JUnit, TestNG)
* Code coverage (e.g., JaCoCo)
* Static analysis reports (e.g., Checkstyle, PMD)
* Custom HTML reports (e.g., Allure, Extent)

#### ✅ Plugins Used:

* HTML Publisher Plugin
* JUnit Plugin
* Cobertura, JaCoCo, etc.

#### 🔧 Sample:

```groovy
post {
  always {
    junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
    archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', fingerprint: true
    publishHTML (target: [
      reportDir: 'reports/html',
      reportFiles: 'index.html',
      reportName: 'Test Report'
    ])
  }
}
```

---

### 3. **Trigger Downstream Jobs**

After a successful build, you may want to:

* Deploy artifacts
* Run integration tests
* Build another dependent module

#### 🔧 Setup:

* Go to **Post-build Actions**
* Select **“Build other projects”**
* Enter downstream job name

#### ✅ Options:

* Trigger **only if build succeeds**
* Trigger **regardless of result**
* Pass artifacts using **Parameterized Trigger Plugin**

---

### 📥 Where Are Artifacts Stored?

* Artifacts are stored on the Jenkins master in the job workspace:

  ```
  $JENKINS_HOME/jobs/<job-name>/builds/<build-number>/archive/
  ```
* Accessible through:

  * Jenkins Web UI
  * REST API
  * Direct file access (if allowed)

---

### 🧹 Artifact Retention Policy

You can configure Jenkins to:

* Keep artifacts for only **N builds**
* Discard builds/artifacts after a period

#### 🔧 Manage from:

* Job → Configure → “Discard Old Builds”

```yaml
Max # of builds to keep: 10
Max # of days to keep artifacts: 7
```

## ✅ Summary: Key Benefits of Artifacts and Post-Build Actions

| Feature            | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Archive Artifacts  | Store build output (e.g., JARs, logs)                     |
| Post-Build Email   | Notify devs/testers with build results or reports         |
| Report Archiving   | Save test coverage, lint, HTML reports                    |
| Downstream Jobs    | Trigger chained builds (test → deploy)                    |
| Artifact Retention | Manage disk space by cleaning up old builds automatically |

Let me know when you’re ready for the **Interview Questions and Scenario-Based Q\&A** for this topic.

Here are the **interview questions and scenario-based Q\&A** for the topic: **Artifacts and Archive in Jenkins**.

---

## ✅ **Interview Questions – Basic to Advanced**

---

### 🟢 **Basic Level**

1. **What are artifacts in Jenkins?**

   > Artifacts are files generated during a build (like JARs, WARs, logs, reports) that are archived and accessible through the Jenkins UI.

2. **How do you archive artifacts in Jenkins?**

   > In the job configuration, under **Post-build Actions**, use **“Archive the artifacts”** and specify file patterns like `**/target/*.jar`.

3. **What file pattern format does Jenkins use to archive artifacts?**

   > Jenkins uses **Ant-style wildcards**, e.g., `**/*.log`, `build/*.zip`.

4. **Where are archived artifacts stored on disk?**

   > `$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/<job-name>/builds/<build-number>/archive/`

5. **What happens if the artifact path is incorrect or files don't exist?**

   > Jenkins marks the build as **unstable**, unless configured to ignore missing files.

---

### 🟡 **Intermediate Level**

6. **How can archived artifacts be accessed?**

   > Via Jenkins Web UI under the build → "Artifacts", or programmatically via REST API.

7. **What is the purpose of using fingerprinting when archiving artifacts?**

   > To **track** where an artifact was created and used, ensuring traceability across builds/jobs.

8. **Can Jenkins delete old artifacts automatically?**

   > Yes, using the **“Discard Old Builds”** option to set retention policies based on days or build count.

9. **What is the difference between archiving an artifact and publishing a report?**

   > Archiving stores raw files (e.g., logs, JARs), while publishing renders **interactive reports** (e.g., HTML reports) using plugins.

10. **What plugins can be used to archive and display reports?**

    > Examples include:

    * **JUnit plugin** (test results)
    * **HTML Publisher Plugin** (HTML reports)
    * **JaCoCo plugin** (code coverage)

---

### 🔴 **Advanced / Integration Questions**

11. **How can you pass artifacts from one job to another?**

    > Use **Parameterized Trigger Plugin** with “Copy artifacts from another project”.

12. **How can you attach archived artifacts to email notifications?**

    > Use the **Email Extension Plugin** with advanced configuration to attach files or link to artifacts.

13. **How do you archive test reports in a Jenkins Pipeline job?**

    > Use `archiveArtifacts` and `junit` steps in the `post` section of a Jenkinsfile:

    ```groovy
    post {
      always {
        junit '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
        archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar'
      }
    }
    ```

14. **What is the role of the `publishHTML` step in Jenkins Pipelines?**

    > Publishes HTML reports (e.g., custom test dashboards) with links in the Jenkins UI.

15. **What happens if you don’t archive artifacts in Jenkins?**

    > The files will be deleted when the workspace is cleaned or the build is rotated, making them unavailable for download or reference.

---

## 🧠 **Scenario-Based Interview Questions**

---

### 📘 **Scenario 1:**

**Q:** Your team builds a `.war` file and wants to make it downloadable after every successful build. How do you set this up?
**A:**

* Use the **"Archive the artifacts"** post-build action.
* Specify pattern: `**/target/*.war`
* After the build, the artifact will appear as a downloadable link under the build details.

---

### 📘 **Scenario 2:**

**Q:** A Jenkins job fails because it couldn’t find any files to archive. What could be the reason?
**A:**

* Incorrect file path or pattern in the **“Archive the artifacts”** section.
* The build step that generates the files failed.
* The artifact generation folder (e.g., `target/`) doesn't exist due to a skipped build phase.

---

### 📘 **Scenario 3:**

**Q:** You want to publish a test result HTML report after every build. How will you do it?
**A:**

* Install **HTML Publisher Plugin**
* Use “Publish HTML Reports” post-build action
* Set directory (e.g., `reports/html`), index file (e.g., `index.html`), and report name.

---

### 📘 **Scenario 4:**

**Q:** You want to automatically delete artifacts after 7 days to save disk space. What Jenkins setting do you use?
**A:**

* Enable **“Discard Old Builds”** in the job configuration
* Set “Days to keep artifacts” to `7`.

---

### 📘 **Scenario 5:**

**Q:** You have two jobs – Job A builds a `.jar`, and Job B deploys it. How do you pass the artifact from Job A to Job B?
**A:**

* Archive the `.jar` in Job A
* In Job B, use the **“Copy artifacts from another project”** plugin
* Reference Job A and specify the artifact path
